                        i) one receiver
                        ii) multiple receivers
                b) Non-Durable Queues (Non-Persistent)

        2) Topic
                Publisher -> TOPIC -> Subscriber (Pub/Sub)
                                     i) Durable Subscriber (a copy of msg is saved for all subscribers)
                                    ii) Non-Durable Subscriber (messages are dropped if no subscribers is listening)
