in mac windows key is the right command 

ctrl + d = deletes whole line 
ctrl + Shift + s = saves all 
Ctrl + shift + o = imports anything needed
Ctrl+shift + m = imports specific 
ctrl + shift + f = formats the code 
ctrl + shift + l = will display the shortcuts and many more in dropdown 

shift + fn + left = copies to the left of the cursor -- same for right up and down keys 
ctrl+ alt + down = duplicates the line >>> alt is left option. 

alt+shift+arrows == selects the text in different format 

xml- here shift + left shows you an option.
