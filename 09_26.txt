svn repository learning 

while checking out checkout from a browser window. 

create a maven project first . copy and paste from the 5 minute website. 
2. then commpile get into directory and then > mvn clean install -Dmaven.text.skip=true
3. if build is successfull then create a eclipse file mvn eclipse:eclipse 

4. then add a folder from the torteise svn repository 
5. but target , .class and .project should not be added so we need to add them to the ignore list. 
         so we have to ignore them. how to ignore is right click the folder and torteise svn and the nadd to 
the ignore list.
6. now we have ignored the files. now to check in we have to commit the folder write the 
comment and then check the files that you are checking in. 
7. now it should be in svn repository. 

note: inside the repo browser you need to be able to see the files. with the pom.xml files 

 
note : 
      make a directory create a folder add to the repository and then commit.
